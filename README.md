# Book Search Engine

## Description
This book search engine is driven by two things: data and user demands. It allows users to search for books and create lists for whatever unique purpose the user might have. Users have to register and login to access their information. The application uses a Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, and refactors it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API.

They have the option to register and they can afterwards, once logged in, save books to their list, update them or delete them.
